Design and Aesthetics
The design is modern, angular, and highly contrasting. The primary colors are black (background), deep red/maroon (accents and highlights), and white (text). The use of these colors gives the UI a gritty, intense, or edgy feel, often associated with genres like rock, hip-hop, or gaming platforms. The repeated podcast listing suggests a mockup or template for how individual items are displayed.
